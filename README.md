# Crime Mapping in Detriot

The word crime is defined as “an act or the commission of an act that is forbidden, or the omission of a duty that is commanded by a public law and that makes the offender liable to punishment by that law” (Webster's, 2020). According to (Bartol & Bartol, 2014) “Crime is legally defined as a conduct or failure to act in violation of the law forbidding or commanding it, and for which a range of possible penalties exist upon conviction.” Crime has become a huge issue around the world and it has been increasing at an alarming rate. In today’s world, criminals and crimes are omnipresent. According to  (Chen, et al., 2003), crime can be a simple violation like illegal parking to the traumatizing event such as the attack of 09/11. The intensity and level of crime can vary from one region to the other. No person would want to be a victim to any criminal activity (Sharma, et al., 2015).

# Aim of the Study

The aim of the project is to build an algorithm/model that would assist in predicting crime in Detroit through geo-spatial and temporal techniques so as to aid LEA better strategize their police patrolling at “hotspots”.

# Research Objective of the Study

--To investigate spatial and temporal factors for the purpose of understanding the pattern of crime. 

--To understand if federal holidays play a factor in boosting crime.

--To build classification models.

--To compare various classification models and evaluate the performance of these models.

# Scope of the study

The research is done on USA’s most dangerous city, Detroit as stated in (Forbes, 2020). The data is collected from the Detroit Police Department’s (DPD) records management system and it will reflect only those crimes that have been recorded. The data dates back to 1915 and has been updated until 2020 YTD. It is to be noted that the updated records from DPD are required to be sent to Michigan Incident Crime Reporting (MICR) or the National Incident Based Reporting System. Some incidents that are recorded may involve multiple offence. There are 22 attributes with ~0.2 million observations. This research will concentrate on a comparative study for the last 7 years; 2013 until 2020 YTD.

# Significance of the Study

The projection of criminal activities plays a significant role in LEAs which focuses on making the society a safe place for people to live in. This research report will greatly contribute to the benefit of Detroit and aid the LEAs to better the society, considering the immense increase in crime lately. The research will also aid the Neighbourhood Scouts to effectively monitor the crimes in hotspot areas using the proposed model. This research wants to play a significant part in allowing the general public to be at ease and feel safe in their own neighbourhood. Using the model effectively, the LEAs would be better equipped in handling hotspot areas way in advance, thus reducing the occurrence of crime and conduct hotspot police patrolling using its resources in areas where crime is more prominent. According to (UCL, 2012), concentrated police patrolling is deemed better than random police patrolling. (National Institute of justice, 2020) claims that majority of the US police departments uses hotspot policing as it is considered an effective way of catching criminals.
As for researchers, this paper will help in uncovering the various methods that could be used in the crime prediction model that has not been explored yet. As seen in section 1.2, not many researches have been done using the recent available data on Detroit, thus making it a pioneer study in building and testing a machine learning model for predicting crime to assist the LEA with better strategies for police patrolling. This study intends to serve as a future reference for other researchers who are exploring similar domains.
